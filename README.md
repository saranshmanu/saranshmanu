### Hello, World! It's Saransh. ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate CS graduate exploring different ways of life with new technologies emerging every other day in this fast pacing world. People are innovating and there is a need for developing solutions for the complex challenges being faced by the human generation. I love to share my ideas and views about them with the prople, so that if possible the next generation could get inspired and follow their passion for science.

ðŸ’¬ Let's talk about my journey!

I am a MERN stack developer with a history of a fabulous journey about winning at hackathons during my undergraduate college period. Being a winner of the IvyHacks 2020, a finalist at the HackHarvard 2018 and Imagine Cup 2019 World Championship, my team was declared winner at 11 other hackathons conducted by different student chapters. I can analyse the working behind different projects easily and prototype challenging proof-of-concepts in a short duration.
